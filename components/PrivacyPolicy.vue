      <p>
        We at Booster value the trust our fun run participants place in our
        company. We take reasonable steps to safeguard that trust by
        implementing measures aimed at keeping nonpublic personal information
        about fun run participants in a secure environment, and by using that
        information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We gather only the
        information that we need to administer our business, our security and
        the security of our fun run participants in order to provide superior
        products and service. We do not typically share such information with
        third parties except as necessary to provide services to our visitors
        and for the other specific purposes described below.

        Information We Collect and How We Use It
      </h2>

      <p>
        <strong>How We Collect Information.</strong> Most information comes
        directly from the Parents/Guardians of fun run participants when they
        access and use our Internet services (&#8220;Services&#8221;). When we
        use the term &#8220;Business Information&#8221; in this privacy policy,
        we mean information that tells us specifically who a visitor is and
        their contact information, including their name, email address, street
        address and telephone number. We collect Business Information when a
        guardian/representative of a fun run participant uses our Services or
        provides information at our events. Visitors to our Website may also
        provide Business Information and other data by pledging money towards a
        fun run participant. A guardian/representative can access their contacts
        via the Google permissions API if desired. We have taken steps to
        protect the Business Information of our online users by utilizing
        256-bit SSL encryption to help ensure information is secured from
        unauthorized users, and we protect URI data through encrypted variables
        so that end users cannot read data in the address bar of their browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How We Use Information</strong>. We do not rent, lease or sell
        Business Information or Google or Gmail information or contacts to any
        marketeer. All data and contacts transmitted by the Google API and usage
        information is never provided to other visitors or third party websites.

        We may share Business Information or other data collected from visitors
        with our business associates, including unaffiliated third parties who
        assist us in administering the Services. We may use, share or transfer
        Business Information or other data collected from visitors:

      <ul>
        <li>to provide enhanced services;</li>
        <li>to resolve disputes;</li>
        <li>
          to solicit feedback from fun run participants, including potential
          participation in focus groups to assist in improving services;
        </li>
        <li>to maintain and service our systems;</li>
        <li>
          to protect the confidentiality or security of fun run
          participant&#8217;s records;
        </li>
        <li>
          to law enforcement or other government officials to protect Booster or
          any fun run participants, or in connection with an investigation or
          prosecution of possible unlawful activity;
        </li>
        <li>in connection with a sale or merger of Booster;</li>

      </ul>

      <p>
        If fun run participants or their parent/legal guardian (if child is less
        than 13 years old) opt to allow us to use or share Business Information
        and other data with trusted affiliates, independent contractors and
        other businesses for marketing and business purposes, we may choose to
        do so. Fun run participants are provided with an &#8220;access
        code&#8221; to input and view personal information. Should a fun run
        participant choose to give this access code to any third party, for
        whatever reason, Booster is not responsible for any information obtained
        by such third party; provided, however, that fun run participant
        information cannot be viewed or edited by the user once it has been
        submitted even if an access code is entered by an unauthorized user.
