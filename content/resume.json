Victor is a passionate user interface engineer / architect who is skilled at determining good UI development approaches, best practices and then implementing them. For example, at Videa he successfully defined our interface standards, implemented an online code base style guide, constructed our interfaces, and worked well with the UX team to create great user interactions. Plus, without being asked he created a complete standalone demo application to ensure the company would have something functional to show at two NAB conferences. This proactive approach was outstanding and helped the company close a few deals. Besides being talented UI professional, Victor is also a great person to work with. Victor is very personable, funny, and has a positive team based approach to working. I look forward to hiring and working with him again"

I found Victor's attitude refreshing and inspiring, while motivating me and others to be the same. I feel he is an exceptionally skilled developer / designer as well as a leader and would really like to work with him again some day. I feel that his passion for learning and applying that knowledge to the front-end side of development / design is inspirational and think you'll be very fortunate to have him on your team. I hope I get to work with Victor again some day soon."
