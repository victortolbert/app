                <b>Step 1</b> of the Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) helps
                prevention professionals assess community needs, resources, and
                readiness to address substance misuse.

              <p>
                In Step 1 of SAMHSA’s Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF),
                prevention professionals gather and assess data from a variety
                of sources to ensure that substance misuse prevention efforts
                are appropriate and targeted to the needs of communities.
              </p>

              <p>
                Data help to inform the identification and prioritization of
                substance misuse problems, clarify those problems’ impact on
                communities and vulnerable populations, and assess the readiness
                and resources needed to protect against those problems and their
                consequences. Learn more about

                      Every problem is related to its own set of risk and
                      protective factors. After you have selected your
                      prevention priority, assess the factors that are driving
                      or alleviating the problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As the name suggests, risk factors can make certain
                      problems more likely to occur, and protective factors
                      reduce the chance of certain problems occurring.
                      Identifying which risk factors exist in your community
                      could reveal possible areas of need. For example, after
                      your assessment you may determine that neighborhood
                      poverty is a risk factor in your community. Consequently,
                      you identify it as a potential prevention priority.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Your assessment may also reveal protective factors, such
                      as afterschool activities. These protective factors may be
                      used as resources to support your prevention efforts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The factors driving a problem in one community may differ
                      from the factors driving it in another community. One of
                      the most important lessons learned from prevention
                      research is that, to be effective, prevention strategies
                      must address the underlying factors driving a problem. It
                      doesn’t matter how carefully a program or intervention is
                      implemented. If it’s not a good match for the problem,
                      it’s not going to work.

                <b>Step 2</b> of the Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF)
                focuses on identifying resources and readiness for addressing
                substance misuse in communities.
              </p>
              <p>
                States and communities must have the capacity—that is, the
                resources and readiness—to support their chosen prevention
                programs and interventions. Programs that are well-supported are
                more likely to succeed. Community resources and community
                readiness often go hand-in-hand: building resource capacity also
                contributes to greater readiness. For example, when key
                stakeholders are involved in solving problems, they are more
                likely to engage others. This leads to more people recognizing
                the value of prevention and greater community readiness to
                accept prevention interventions.

                building. Broad cultural representation is essential to
                sustaining long-term prevention efforts: the wider your base of
                support, the greater the likelihood you will achieve a
                successful outcome.

                      Increasing community awareness isn’t about increasing the
                      knowledge and awareness of every community member. Rather,
                      it often involves collaborating with key stakeholders who
                      can influence whether your prevention initiative will
                      succeed. To identify these stakeholders, analyze the

                      not yet ready for the planned prevention approach, but who
                      will play a role in its success as stakeholders. Then
                      develop and implement strategies for boosting their

                      When thinking about collaboration, consider including a

                      relationships with those who support your prevention
                      efforts as well as with other stakeholders who may not be

                      Resources exist in your organization and in the community

                As you plan, keep in mind that decisions that reflect the input
                of all stakeholders, whether they are part of a formal coalition
                or informal group of collaborators, are more likely to keep
                stakeholders committed to your program.

                Planning is also crucial to the sustainability of prevention
                outcomes. It establishes the resources needed to maintain
                program activities and greatly increases the likelihood that you
                will achieve your expected outcomes.

              <h4>Selecting Effective Interventions</h4>
              <p>
                Sometimes people want to select interventions that are popular,
                that worked well in a different community, or that they are
                familiar with. However, these are not good reasons for selecting
                an intervention. It is more important that the prevention
                intervention effectively address the priority substance use
                problem and associated risk and protective factors, and that
                intervention is a good fit for the broader community.

                      what constitutes credible evidence of effectiveness, you
                      could start by talking to prevention experts—including
                      your state-level evidence‐based workgroup.

                      In addition to selecting an intervention that is
                      evidence-based, you need to ensure that the intervention,

                        <b>Conceptual fit:</b> An intervention has good
                        conceptual fit if it directly addresses one or more of
                        the priority factors driving a specific substance use
                        problem and has been shown to produce positive outcomes
                        for members of the target population. To determine the
                        conceptual fit, ask, “Will this intervention have an
                        impact on at least one of our community’s priority risk

                      <li>
                        <b>Practical fit:</b> An intervention has good practical
                        fit if it is culturally relevant for the target
                        population, the community has capacity to support it,
                        and if it enhances or reinforces existing prevention
                        activities. To determine the practical fit of an
                        intervention, ask, “Is this intervention appropriate for
                        our community?”

                    <p>
                      When a prevention program is implemented as its developer
                      intended, there is greater likelihood that its impact will
                      be similar to the settings where it was first implemented
                      or tested. Maintaining fidelity means keeping most
                      elements of the program the same. However, programs may
                      need to be adapted to gain greater community acceptance or
                      in response to the contexts of a particular setting.
                      Budget constraints, staff availability, time limitations,
                      or other issues may make adaptation necessary.

                      In these situations, finding the right approach to stay
                      faithful to the original evidence-based design and address
                      the target audience’s unique characteristics requires
                      balancing fidelity and adaptation. When you change an
                      intervention, you may be compromising outcomes. Even so,
                      implementing a program that requires some adaptation may
                      be more efficient and cost-effective than designing a
                      program from scratch.

                        Effect size refers to the magnitude of the effects of an
                        intervention. The smaller an intervention’s effect size,
                        the more careful you want to be about changing anything.
                        You don’t want to inadvertently compromise any good
                        you’re doing. In general, adaptations to programs with
                        large effect sizes are less likely to affect expected
                        outcomes.

                        capacity to deliver it as it was designed is a better
                        choice.

                        likely to be effective. If you’re not sure which
                        elements are core, consult the program developer, an

                        principles are more likely to be effective. Adaptations
                        should be consistent with the science.

                The evaluation step of SAMHSA’s Strategic Prevention Framework
                (SPF) quantifies the challenges and successes of implementing a
                prevention program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Evaluation is the systematic collection and analysis of
                information about program activities, characteristics, and
                outcomes. The evaluation step of the Strategic Prevention
                Framework (SPF) is not just about collecting information, but
                using that information to improve the effectiveness of a
                prevention program. After evaluation, planners may decide
                whether or not to continue the program.
              </p>
              <p>
                Prevention practitioners need to evaluate how well the program
                was delivered and how successful it was in achieving the
                expected outcomes. Once the program has been evaluated,
                prevention planners typically report evaluation results to
                stakeholders, which can include community members and lawmakers.
                Stakeholders can promote your program, increase public interest,
                and possibly help to secure additional funding.

                      Engaging stakeholders who represent the populations you
                      hope to reach greatly increases the chance that your
                      evaluation efforts will be successful. Stakeholders can
                      dictate how (or even whether) evaluation results are
                      shared. Stakeholder involvement also helps to ensure that
                      the evaluation design, including methods and the
                      instruments used, is consistent with the cultural norms of
                      the people you serve. Learn more about

                      Cultural competence, the ability to interact effectively
                      with people of different cultures, helps to ensure the

                      Cultural competence is the ability to interact effectively
                      with people of different cultures. In practice, both
                      individuals and organizations can be culturally competent.
                      Culture must be considered at every step of the Strategic
                      Prevention Framework (SPF). “Culture” is a term that goes
                      beyond just race or ethnicity. It can also refer to such
                      characteristics as age, gender, sexual orientation,
                      disability, religion, income level, education,
                      geographical location, or profession.
