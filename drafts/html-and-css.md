## HTML Seleton

```html
<!--
  In the past, the DOCTYPE was needed to specify HTML versions.
  As of HTML5, providing `html` is sufficient.
  It is somewhere between a proper HTML tag, and an HTML comment.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- Add the appropriate language for your site -->
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!--
      UTF-8 is a character set including many universal characters.
      This is an essential tag for all websites, to avoid seeing
      weird boxes like ▢▢▢
    -->
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <!--
      This critical tag ensures that items on the screen scale
      correctly on mobile devices. Without this tag, content may
      appear VERY tiny.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <!--
      Set your name and a brief description.
      Used by search engines.
    -->
    <meta name="author" content="Your name" />
    <meta name="description" content="Brief description" />
    <!--
      `og` stands for Open Graph, which is a protocol for how your
      website appears when linked to from another site. These tags
      are critical to ensuring your site gains an appropriate card
      when sharing on social media.
    -->
    <meta property="og:title" content="Your Page Title" />
    <meta property="og:description" content="Brief description" />
    <meta property="og:image" content="/some-image.png" />
    <meta property="og:url" content="/this-page.html" />
    <meta property="og:site_name" content="Your Site Name" />
    <!--
      `twitter` is similar to Open Graph, but specific to Twitter.
      There are multiple card types you can choose from.
      Learn more on Twitter's documentation:
      https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started
    -->
    <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
    <meta name="twitter:image:alt" content="Image descriptipn" />
    <!-- Include one or more CSS files -->
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <!--
      A favicon is the small picture that shows up in the browser's
      tab. Historically, these used a proprietary ".ico" format, and
      you needed to provide many different sizes.
      Happily, you can now provide a single vector graphic in SVG
      format. It will scale to any size, and still look crisp.
    -->
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
    <!-- This title shows up in the page's tab, next to the favicon -->
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Your content here!</h1>
    <!-- If necessary, include JS -->
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
